# For this project, rather than writing a report, you will analyze a new data set (not the same as Capstone I) of your choice from Kaggle, then present your analysis via a pre-recorded Loom video. You will need a webcam for this assignment.
# 
# Similar to the previous capstone, you will be analyzing data and presenting, just in a different format, and with a new data set.
# 
# With pre-recorded video:
#   Using Loom or similar, you will be showing your screen and your analysis - your graphs, charts, results, and explanations of the data - while your video is somewhere on the screen. Part of this job is presenting information to other people.
# 
# Either way:
#   Present your findings, hypotheses, analysis, graphs, charts, methodologies, and anything else relevant in video format. 
# 
# Below are links for Loom, as well as several sites where various data sets can be found.
# 
# When submitted please schedule a time to present here: https://calendly.com/d/48z-p4c-5kb/data-capstone-presentation
